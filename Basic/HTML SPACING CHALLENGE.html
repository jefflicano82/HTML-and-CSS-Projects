		<p>Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,<br>
		Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,<br>
		Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, &#38; who more faithless?)<br>
		Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,<br>
		Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,<br>
		Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,<br>
		The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?<br>

		<i><span style="color:red">Answer.</span></i><br>
		That you are here—that life exists and identity,<br>
		That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.<br></p>
		<p><em>-Walt Whitman&#169;</em></p>
